# Common Prefix Finder

## Overview

The `Common Prefix Finder` is a simple JavaScript function designed to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings. If there is no common prefix, it will return an empty string. This utility can be useful in situations where you need to identify shared beginnings of strings, such as file paths or URLs.

## Example Usage

```javascript
const result = getCommonPrefix(["flower", "flow", "flight"]);
console.log(result); // Output: "fl"
```
